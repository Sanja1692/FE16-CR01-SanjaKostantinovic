Code Review 1

Good morning, students! 
Welcome to your 1st Code Review!  As you have made some progress with HTML5 and CSS3, it is time to create your first Code Review and your first website! 

You will need to achieve more than 60 points to pass this CodeReview successfully.  

You will be graded according to the results achieved. Please see the number of points for each task below.  

The grading system has the following rules: 

Up to 60 points = red 

Between 61 and 79 = yellow 

Over 80 = green 

You can submit your solution (as a GitHub project link) until Saturday 14.05.2022 at 18:00:00. 

Project description: 
You will create a landing page for the FullStackWebDeveloper course of Code Factory. 

Please examine the example given below and use it as a guide in order to create your index.html: 
TIP: Using positioning (relative, absolute, fixed, etc.) will allow you to overlay elements with others and also place them in a very specific position in the document. 

Please download the images from the ZIP file pics available below at the bottom of this document. Place the folder pics in the root of the project. These images should be used on your 1st CodeReview project. 

For this Code Review, the following criteria will be graded: 

(10 points) Create a GitHub Repository named: FE16-CR01-YourName. Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (lms). Make sure the repository has your project before submitting it. See an example of a GitHub link below: 

https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git 

Please remember to set your repository to private and you must invite codefactorygit as a collaborator! 

(10 points) Correct usage of the HTML structure (proper order of HTML elements)  

(10 points) Correct position and sizing of nav elements such as Code factory Logo, the buttons and the input-field used as a search bar within the navigation bar. 

(10 points) Correct placement of the central image as a background. (It can be inserted as an image tag or background-image) 

(15 points) Correct position of the Text and devices picture in front of the central image. 

(20 points) Correct placement of the elements in the section “Course Technologies” as shown in the example 

(10 points) Correct placement of image and elements in the footer section using Code factory Logo. 

(10 points) Correct indentation that makes it easier to read your code.

(15 points) Use CSS selectors (classes and/or IDs) to style your web page (colors, font size, font style etc.). 

  

Bonus Points: 

(10 points) Add the buttons at the bottom/center of the card using CSS positioning. 

(10 points) Add links to the footer that lead to other local HTML pages that you will additionally create. For these bonus points you are free to provide your design/layout solutions for these additional pages, e.g.: About, Blog, etc.

Hi Sanja! You have a good CR1. The page looks good and you respected the given design.

Please find below my suggestions:
- the words should be splitted with - or _ for the css classes or ids(.navlist to .nav-list)
- try avoiding selecting elements in css by their html tag and use a class or id instead. Now because it is a very small page it doesnt make a difference but it will start being confusing when the project is bigger with multiple css and html files.
- the footer should not have position:relative.
- the main html should normally be named index.html

Good Job! If you have any questions please let me know.

Delia
